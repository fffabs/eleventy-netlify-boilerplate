**My name is Fabio Basile.** I am a designer, business owner and podcaster. This is my personal blog.

I am the cofounder of [Fortnight Studio](https://fortnight.studio), a boutique design and development studio specialising in branding and mobile apps.

I co-host [The Bearded Heretics](https://beardedheretics.fm), a weekly show where Till and I discuss about life, friendship, business and more.

I write [The Small Things](/newsletter), a weekly newsletter where I share articles, links and resources I discover throughout the week.
