**My name is Fabio Basile, I am a designer, business owner and podcaster.**
This is my personal blog.

I am the cofounder of [Fortnight Studio](https://fortnight.studio), a boutique design and development studio specialising in branding and mobile apps.

I co-host a show with my friend Till where we discuss about life, friendship and business. It's called [The Bearded Heretics](https://beardedheretics.fm).

I write [The Small Things](/newsletter), a weekly newsletter where I discuss about a topic and share links and resources I come across during the week.
