![Fabio's Photo](/static/img/Photo_Me_Front.jpg)

I am Fabio Basile. A software engineer turned designer interested in creating simple, fun and interactive products.

For over thirteen years I have designed interfaces, icons and identities for hundreds of businesses. I have worked with entrepreneurs like Whitney Wolfe of Bumble, automobile giants like BMW and Porsche, music powers like Polydor Records, and mobile innovators like Samsung and OnePlus.

I enjoy public speaking and teaching about design and business. On average, I attend three public events per year.

I co-run a purposefully small [design and development studio](https://fortnight.studio) specialised in branding, interface and interaction design as well as mobile development currently working with some of the hottest startups around.

The weekly newsletter I write is called The Small Things, it's all about the small findings I come across on the internet every week, from innovative technology to well designed experiences and life-changing events, it's a curated list of goodness.

I engage in nerdy conversations on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fffabs).
